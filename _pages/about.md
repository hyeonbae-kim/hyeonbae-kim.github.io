Hello! I'm **Hyeonbae Kim**, a master's student in the **Department of Artificial Intelligence** at **Kyung Hee University**, and a member of the **Augmented Intelligence Lab**.

My research focuses on **Explainable AI (XAI)** and **Dense Video Captioning**, with a particular interest in applying **Vision-Language Models** to healthcare. Recently, I contributed to the following publications:
- **AAAI 2025** (2nd Author): HiCM^2 : Hierarchical Compact Memory Modeling for Dense Video Captioning.
- **MICCAI 2024** (1st Author): Mask-Free Neuron Concept Annotation for Interpreting Neural Networks in Medical Domain.
- **CVPR 2024** (2nd Author): WWW: A Unified Framework for Explaining What, Where and Why of Neural Networks by Interpretation of Neuron Concept.
- **CVPR 2024** (2nd Author): Do You Remember? Dense Video Captioning with Cross-Modal Memory Retrieval
- **ICIP Workshop 2024** (3rd Author): Retrieval-Augmented Natural Language Reasoning for Explainable Visual Question Answering

Iâ€™m passionate about leveraging AI to solve real-world problems, especially in the healthcare domain, and I aim to pursue a Ph.D. to further my expertise.

Feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/hyeonbae-kim) for more projects, or contact me via email: **hyeonbae.kim@khu.ac.kr**.

* Template
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
